# Jon's Portfolio Site

This site began as a lab assignment while attending Code Fellows in Seattle, WA. For the short term this site will be the target of the assignment features and content as defined on a Trello board.

Longer term this site will be used to showcase my work as I gain skills and expertice an many aspects of software development.
