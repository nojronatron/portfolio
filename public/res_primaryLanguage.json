    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I am a Software Developer with experience in software testing, systems administration, project planning and team leadership. I began my career in technology as a Helpdesk Associate, solving desktop issues of staff and assisting in maintenance of the network and systems. My interest in IT was piqued, so I went to Cascadia College and earned an AA in Network Technologies, making Honors and President's List multiple times, and created a computer asset-tracking tool for the Campus SysAdmins, helping them forecast budget needs. Following graduation I interning at a Citrix office in Redmond, WA, maintaining computer lab hardware and providing basic helpdesk support for the small remote office. I was promoted to Systems Administrator and collaborated with a software developer to design and deploy a hardware management tool that helped increase equipment sharing between users, and simplified budget forecasting for the team. Over several years in this role I specified equipment like network infrastructure, servers and workstations, and SAN and NAS equipment, which I also deployed and maintained. I built-out dev and test team environments on hardware, hypervisors, and Azure, and and upgraded the computer lab network, supporting more devices and users, and segmenting campus and isolated networks using VLANs and routing. I took the lead in investigating and resolving intermitted issues with global Distributed File System shares using PowerShell and other tools, removing access errors and improving network performance. Working with PowerShell helped build my interest in software development so I earned a certification in Software Test Engineering from Bellevue College, where I picked up skills in Python, C#, Git, SQL, and software development lifecycles. Soon after, I moved into a software testing role and designed test plans and executed tests, submitting concrete yet succinct bug reports, and validating buf-fixes on multiple simultaneous projects. I developed automated build-and-deploy scripts using PowerShell, and created one-button-execution UI testing using Selenium Driver and Python, detecting UI bugs and allowing more time for continued Lab Manager and Systems Admin tasks completion. I returned to Bellevue College to complete C# Programming training and started to enjoy working in object-oriented, stronly-typed languages. Wanting to learn more and work on teams, I attained a certificate in Advanced Software Development in Java from Code Fellows in Seattle, WA. As a bonus, I learned how to build full-stack Web Apps using HTML, CSS, JS, React, Express, SQL and No-SQL databases, and work closely with fellow students using agile software development techniques. In between classes and projects I started applying my skills to ham radio by building radio-interfacing electronics and developing software. In one case, a specialized web form was needed by radio operators for an upcoming event. I customized an existing web form, updating the UI for simplicity and to be accessible to elderly, limited visdio, or limited mobility users. I refactored the form's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for clean, readability, and added elements and responsiveness to the form. In late 2022, I met an enthusiastic React developer and we jointly designed, developed, and bug tested a React SPA using common software development tools and technique, all while completely remote from each other. I enjoy developing software solutions for web and desktop, and engaging in finding solutions that make sense for the context of the application. I look forward to working on a diverse, engaged software development team, creating and refining technical solutions and delighting customers.ðŸ‘‹",
