      "ðŸ‘‹  I am a Software Developer with experience in software testing, systems administration, project planning and team leadership. I began my career in technology as a Helpdesk Associate, solving Windows desktop issues for the staff, and assisting with network maintenance activities. My interest in IT was piqued so I went to Cascadia College and earned an Associate Degree in Network Technologies, making Honors and President's List multiple times. During this time I created a computer asset-tracking database tool for the Campus SysAdmins, helping them track computers and forecast budget needs. Following graduation I interned at a Citrix in their Redmond, WA office, maintaining computer lab hardware and providing basic helpdesk support.",
      "I was hired full-time as a Systems Administrator, managing the computer lab hardware, network, and Windows systems. Through collaboration with a software developer I helped design and deploy a hardware management tool that increased computer lab equipment utilization and simplified budget forecasting for the team's leadership. Over several years in this role I specified replacement networking, server, and storage equipment, and then deployed and maintained it for dev, test, and production environments. I also built-out dev and test team environments on hardware, hypervisors and Azure. ",
      "I specified an computer lab network upgrade, acquired bids for electrical work and upgrades, and implemented VLANs to segment networks to isolate traffic for security and to support dev and production systems network performance and routing requirements. When a in intermitted issue with global Distributed File System shares affected global Citrix users, I took the lead and used Direcotry tools and PowerShell to find the problem in AD and DNS, defined a fix and gained approval to implement it with the Global AD Administrators, and resolved the problem. ",
      "Working in an advanced software development group, coupled with my PowerShell experiences built my interest in software development, so I earned a certification in Software Test Engineering from Bellevue College where I picked up Python, C#, Git, SQL, and agile software development processes. Soon after, I moved into a software testing role at Citrix, designing test plans, executing tests, submitted concrete yet succinct bug reports, and validating bug-fixes on multiple projects, simultaneously. I developed automated build-and-deploy scripts using PowerShell, and created one-button-execution UI testing using Selenium Driver and Python, detecting UI bugs and allowing more time for continued Lab Manager and Systems Admin tasks completion. ",
      "I returned to Bellevue College to complete C# Programming training and started to enjoy working with object-oriented, stronly-typed languages. Wanting to go further, I earned a certificate in Advanced Software Development in Java from Code Fellows in Seattle, WA. As a bonus, I learned how to build full-stack Web Apps using HTML, CSS, JS, React, Express, SQL and No-SQL databases, as well as pair-programming techniques, software design patterns, and learned about datastructures and algorithms. ",
      "In between classes and projects I started applying my skills to my ham radio hobby by building radio-interfacing electronics and developing software to capture and transform data. For example, a specialized web form was needed by radio operators for an upcoming event where data must be transmitted by 'email over ham radio'. I customized an existing web form, updating the UI for simplicity and accessibility including those with limited vision and limited mobility users. I refactored the form's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for clean, readability, and added elements and responsiveness to the form. ",
      "In late 2022, I met an enthusiastic React developer and we jointly designed, developed, and bug tested a React SPA using common software development tools and technique, all while completely remote from each other. ",
      "I enjoy developing software solutions for web and desktop, working with engaging people, and finding solutions that make sense for the context of the end user. I look forward to working on a diverse software development team creating and refining technical solutions and delighting customers. ðŸ‘‹"

The project has been through many version, from Console application to what it is now - a live, playable Azure WebApp. I learned a lot about C#, Dot NET, and web development, which made it clear to me I wanted to learn more about building capable, fun websites!",
