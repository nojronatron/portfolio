      "ðŸ‘‹  I am a Software Developer with experience in software testing, systems administration, project planning and team leadership. I began my career in technology as a Helpdesk Associate, then as a Computer Lab Technician, and later as a Windows Systems Administrator. While earning a Associate Degree in Network Technologies, I created a computer asset-tracking database tool for the campus IT team that helped track computers and forecast budget needs.",
      "Later, as a Systems Administrator at Citrix Systems, I managed the computer lab hardware, data storage, and network systems. Through collaboration with a software developer I helped design and deploy a hardware management tool that increased computer lab equipment utilization and simplified budget forecasting for the team's leadership. I also built-out dev and test team environments on hardware, hypervisors and Azure, reducing time-to-deploy for dev and test activities. ",
      "I acquired bids for electrical work and network upgrades, and implemented routing and VLAN technologies to support secure dev and production systems network performance. As an Systems Admin of a globally reaching Active Directory deployment, I was responsible for network operations supporting the Engineering teams. I took the lead on several occasions to push for implementation of new features, solving issues affecting users globally, and upgrading services like SharePoint, improving user experience and productivity.",
      "Working in an advanced software development group, coupled with my growing experiences with PowerShell, I earned a certification in Software Test Engineering from Bellevue College where I picked up Python, C#, Git, SQL, and agile software development processes. Soon after, I moved into a software testing role at Citrix, designing test plans, executing tests, submitted concrete yet succinct bug reports, and validating bug-fixes on multiple projects, simultaneously. I developed automated build-and-deploy scripts using PowerShell, and created one-button-execution UI testing using Selenium Driver and Python, detecting UI bugs and allowing more time for continued Lab Manager and Systems Admin tasks completion. ",
      "I returned to Bellevue College to complete C# Programming training and started to enjoy working with object-oriented, stronly-typed languages. Wanting to go further, I earned a certificate in Advanced Software Development in Java from Code Fellows in Seattle, WA, where I learned how to build full-stack Web Apps using HTML, CSS, JS, React, Express, SQL and No-SQL databases, as well as collaborative software development techniques including pair-programming and use of agile tools like Trello and Miro to design solutions and manage development progress.",
      "In between classes and projects I applied my skills to my ham radio hobby by building radio-interfacing electronics and developing software to capture and transform data. For example, I made improvements and added specific, necessary features to an existing web-based form that radio operators use to transmit urgent, emergent, or logistical messages via 'email over ham radio'. I updated the UI for simplicity and accessibility including those with limited vision and limited mobility users, and refactored the code to be clean and easily readable. ",
      "In late 2022, I met an enthusiastic React developer and we jointly designed, developed, and bug tested a React SPA using common software development tools and technique, all while completely remote from each other. This project is a web-based Bingo game that allows a presenter to create a custom Bingo board and share a link to the board with their audience. The audience can then play Bingo by clicking on the board's squares to mark them as 'called'. The presenter can see the audience's boards and can call out the next square to be marked. The project is currently in development to be a full-stack app, published to Netlify and Azure App Services.",
      "I enjoy developing software solutions for web and desktop, working with engaging people, and finding solutions that make sense for the context of the end user. I look forward to working on a diverse software development team creating and refining technical solutions and delighting customers. ðŸ‘‹"

      "description": "Many of my volunteer adventures include tracking cyclists or runners on a course. For one event, Bigfoot 200, hams use \"email over ham radio\" to send in runner reports. I developed a multi-project solution using DotNET 8 and WPF that watches for these reports, parses and logs the location data, and then posts the data to an ASP.NET Minimal API Server with an Entity Framework Core DB. The ham responsible for maintaining runner locations, can run reports against the logged data and answer questions like which runners has passed through a specific Aid Station. While specific to Bigfoot 200, the project is designed to be adaptable to other events. This project was designed to work in conjunction with the Bigfoot Bib Report Form project, and had its first trial-run in August 2024.",

Hams from all around Washington and Oregon volunteer to provide communications for this event including, information on runner locations, as well as logistical and emergency communications with Net Control near the event base. The Winlink Development Team (www.winlink.org) developed a form to capture participant data at checkpoints or Aid Stations for events like this. I cleaned-up and customized the form using HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript to meet the needs of Aid Station HAMs while tracking runners for this event. Design improvements include: Use of accessible colors and fonts, selected control highlighting, keyboard navigation, and a responsive UI for desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. Features include: Automated subject line generation, comma-separated data display, and data backup and restore, allowing standalone form usage so a HAM can fill out the form, save the data, and then sneaker net it to a Winlink station for transmission. Every year the form is updated with new features and improvements using input from the HAMs who use it.",
